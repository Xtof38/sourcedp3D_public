dp3D is a research code intended to simulate mostly materials science related problems. It is developped at https://simap.grenoble-inp.fr/ laboratory at the Univ. Grenoble Alpes. You can application examples at https://simap.grenoble-inp.fr/fr/equipes/animations-discrete-element-method.

To run dp3D (on linux distribution only), you need to:
1. download the latest version of the dp3D user manual from https://www.overleaf.com/read/xvtqjkgrppvd;

2. download the dp3D directory into the directory where you have your executables, typically /usr/local/
make sure you have the neceesary rights and that the path is declared into your .bashrc or .bash_profile;

3. download the dp3D_examples  directory that contains examples that are good starting points for simulations;

Do not rush into simulating complicated and large simulations right away. Run gradually through the user manual and its examples to educate yourself.

when executing dp3D, if you run into troubles, type:
ulimit -s unlimited
to solve the issue
