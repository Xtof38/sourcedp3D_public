---------------------------------------------------------------------------        
some options (shown as (-anim)) may be used to generate gif for animation as:
vdp3D -anim(n) -option2 file  generates gif for animation every 
                                       n (n<10) _coord file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

vdp3D (-anim) -disp(x,y,z,r) file 
displays displacements in x, y or z direction or its norm (-disp), or the radial disp (dispr)

vdp3D -disp_field  file 
displays the displacement field of a 2D section

vdp3D -ellipsoid  file

displays max contact force

vdp3D (-anim) -fract_bonds 
displays bonds fracture number

vdp3D -anim -fract_bonds_fine 
displays bonds fracture number and crack growth precisely described

vdp3D -histo_bonds
displays the history (by timestep) of bonds fracture

vdp3D -i file
displays the packing with ivdp3D as the default script

vdp3D -iref file
displays the reference sphere

vdp3D -level file
displays the levels of particles to track fracture

vdp3D -keep file
