|   ovdp3D usage: ovdp3D [-option1]  file                                   |
|   where files ... are coordinate files generated by dp3D to be            |
|   visualized with ovito                                                   |
|   use ovdp3D -option1_xyz                                                 |
|   to generate only a .xyz file that can be red by ovito                   |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------        


ovdp3D -bonds file
generates an image showing number of non-broken bonds

vdp3D -center_clumps  file

ovdp3D -class  file 
generates a coord from file with non-broken clusters 

ovdp3D (-anim) -contact file 
generates an image of the packing showing sintered contacts
	
ovdp3D -crack  file 
generates a coord from file with selected bonds broken 	

ovdp3D (-anim) -damage file
generates damage_file.xyz files with only damaged particles

ovdp3D (-anim) -deltats file
generates an image of the packing showing tangential contact strain network

ovdp3D (-anim) -dens file
generates an image showing particle relative density, using Voronoi radical tesselation

ovdp3D (-anim) -disp(x,y or z) file 
generates an image of the packing showing displacements in x, y or z direction or its norm (-disp)

ovdp3D -disp_field  file 
displays the displacement field of a 2D section

ovdp3D (-anim) -eps(x,y or z)  file
generates an image of the packing showing local strains

ovdp3D (-anim) -force file
generates an image of the packing showing max contact force

ovdp3D (-anim) -fract_bonds 
generates an image with bonds fracture number

ovdp3D -anim -fract_bonds_fine 
generates an animation with bonds fracture number and crack growth precisely described

ovdp3D -histo_bonds
generates an image of the history of bonds fracture

ovdp3D -i file
generates an image from file with ivdp3D as the default script

ovdp3D -iref file
generates an image of the packing showing the reference sphere

ovdp3D -keep file
generates a coord from file with only selected particles kept

ovdp3D -Nnetwork file
displays the normal force network of a 2D section

ovdp3D -notch file 
generates a coord from file with selected particles removed 

ovdp3D -normal_axis file 
displays the normal vector of clusters (needs the _clumps file)

ovdp3D -object file
generates an image of the packing showing the cylin and spher objects

ovdp3D -pick file
generates a coord with picked particles

ovdp3D -probe file
